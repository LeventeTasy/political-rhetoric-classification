# Analysis

## 1. Data Collection
The data was collected between *December 2025* and *January 2026*. The model uses approximately **1,700 articles**, half of which are propaganda rhetoric articles and half of which are independent rhetoric articles. Since the data was collected only in the last month, it can only produce reliable results in *current politics*.

The data collection process consisted of two main phases, ensuring relevance and a balanced data set.
### a) URL Discovery via RSS Feeds 
I classified the news sources into two categories: *Independent* and *Pro-Government*. For data collection, I used the `feedparser` library to monitor RSS feeds.
