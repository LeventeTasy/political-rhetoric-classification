# Political Rhetoric Classification in Hungarian Media

## Overview
This project presents a machine learning pipeline specifically designed to detect and classify political rhetoric and potentially manipulative content in Hungarian-language news articles. Given the complex linguistic features of Hungarian, the project utilizes an ensemble approach to distinguish between **neutral reporting** and **propagandistic discourse**.

*For detailed methodology, hyperparameter tuning, and rhetorical analysis, please refer to the [**Full Documentation**](DOCUMENTATION.md).*

## Methodology
The core of the system is a **Voting Classifier** ensemble that leverages two distinct mathematical approaches to text classification:

* **LinearSVC:** Highly effective for high-dimensional sparse data generated by TF-IDF vectorization.
* **GradientBoostingClassifier:** Captures non-linear relationships and nuanced patterns in the rhetoric that linear models might miss.

### Data & Preprocessing
- **Dataset Size:** Trained on a curated corpus of **~1,700 Hungarian news articles**.
- **Collection Period:** Data was collected between **December 2025 and January 2026**.
- **Preprocessing:** - Custom Hungarian tokenizer.
  - Stopword removal (standard Hungarian set).
  - TF-IDF vectorization with n-gram support.
- **Output:** The model provides a binary label (0/1) and a calibrated probability score.

## Performance
The model achieves a robust **89% overall accuracy**. Below is the detailed classification report:

| Metric | Class 0 (Neutral rhetoric) | Class 1 (Propagandistic rhetoric) | Weighted Avg |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Precision** | 0.87 | 0.91 | 0.89 |
| **Recall** | 0.92 | 0.86 | 0.89 |
| **F1-Score** | 0.89 | 0.88 | 0.89 |
| **Accuracy** | | | **0.89** |

> **Note:** The high precision for Class 1 (0.91) indicates that when the model flags an article as propaganda, it is correct in 91% of the cases, minimizing "false accusations."

## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeventeTasy/political-rhetoric-classification
cd political-rhetoric-classifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
The pipeline is designed to be flexible, accepting both URLs (for automatic scraping) and raw text.
```python
from classifier import predict_bias
from joblib import load

# Load the pre-trained ensemble model
model = load('models/ensemble_pipeline_id1_0_89.joblib')

# Example: Analysis via URL
url = "https://example.com/article"
result = predict_bias(model, url)

print(result)
```

### Output examples:

- ```Propagandistic rhetoric, 80.46% chance for containing propagandistic rhetoric | URL: https://example.com/article```

- ```Suspicious (Uncertain), 33.48% chance for containing propagandistic rhetoric | URL: https://example.com/article```

- ```Neutral rhetoric, 27.52% chance for containing propagandistic rhetoric | URL: https://example.com/article```

## Ethical Considerations & Disclaimer
This tool is intended for academic research purposes only.

- **Subjectivity**: Defining "propaganda" is inherently complex; the model reflects the patterns found in the training data.
- **No Truth-Discovery**: This model detects rhetorical patterns, not the factual accuracy of the content.
